        <p>Manamadhurai is 8 hours away from Chennai. Manitham is an organization run by 2 motivated ex-gov’t teachers who have taken upon them to setup knowledge-centers across the 15 villages in and around manamadhurai which are truly backward in all stature. DaD in partnership with Globalscholar’s CSR initiative visited, interviewed, finalized a project to be jointly funded and operationized. The mandate was to pick the 5 most backward of the 15 villages and address student’s education related needs immediately.</p>

        <p>These were some of the acute issues that the kids were facing in their villages and knowledge centers run by Manitham, which DaD decided to solve using this project.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Power-shortage and absence of electricity during evenings and nights was a big issue for kids to do their homeworks and study during post-school hours. They gathered near candles or street lamps every day.</p>

        <p><strong>Solution</strong>: DaD purchased Philips – quick-to-charge emergency lamps, which students could charge during day time for 3 hours and use it at night for their group-studies, homeworks for 5+ hours. 30 such lights were given for 5 villages. 6 lights per village or per group of 30 students.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Many kids did not have sufficient accessories and school was about to re-open after the summer vacation.</p>

        <p><strong>Solution</strong>: DaD created an extensive Back-to-School-kit for 150+ students in the 5 villages and in person visited them, conducted magic-shows, interacted with them, made them have loads of fun and distributed the kits. The kit consisted of calculator, drawing/writing accessories, bags, map, log-book and 2 moral story books along with tiffin boxes, bottles and a slate/writing-pad.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem</strong>: The knowledge centers although were 15 in numbers 1 per village, there was only 1 village knowledge center which served as a HUB, which was computerized and had spoken-english tutoring for which many students walked/cycled 10-15 kilometers to attend the training.</p>

        <p><strong>Solution</strong>: DaD decided to adopt 2 such simple centers and computerize them. DaD procured 10 computers from GlobalScholar’s old-PC-recycle-policy, fixed them, transported and set them up in the 2 centers. Soon the new 2 computerized centers will be launched.</p>
