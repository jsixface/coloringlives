            <p>Manamadhurai is 8 hours away from Chennai. Manitham is an organization run by 2 motivated ex-gov’t teachers who have taken upon them to setup knowledge-centers across the 15 villages in and around manamadhurai which are truly backward in all stature. DaD in partnership with Globalscholar’s CSR initiative visited, interviewed, finalized a project to be jointly funded and operationized. The mandate was to pick the 5 most backward of the 15 villages and address student’s education related needs immediately.</p>

            <p>These were some of the acute issues that the kids were facing in their villages and knowledge centers run by Manitham, which DaD decided to solve using this project.</p>

            <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Power-shortage and absence of electricity during evenings and nights was a big issue for kids to do their homeworks and study during post-school hours. They gathered near candles or street lamps every day.</p>

            <p><strong>Solution</strong>: DaD purchased Philips – quick-to-charge emergency lamps, which students could charge during day time for 3 hours and use it at night for their group-studies, homeworks for 5+ hours. 30 such lights were given for 5 villages. 6 lights per village or per group of 30 students.</p>

            <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Many kids did not have sufficient accessories and school was about to re-open after the summer vacation.</p>

            <p><strong>Solution</strong>: DaD created an extensive Back-to-School-kit for 150+ students in the 5 villages and in person visited them, conducted magic-shows, interacted with them, made them have loads of fun and distributed the kits. The kit consisted of calculator, drawing/writing accessories, bags, map, log-book and 2 moral story books along with tiffin boxes, bottles and a slate/writing-pad.</p>

            <p><strong>Problem</strong>: The knowledge centers although were 15 in numbers 1 per village, there was only 1 village knowledge center which served as a HUB, which was computerized and had spoken-english tutoring for which many students walked/cycled 10-15 kilometers to attend the training.</p>

            <p><strong>Solution</strong>: DaD decided to adopt 2 such simple centers and computerize them. DaD procured 10 computers from GlobalScholar’s old-PC-recycle-policy, fixed them, transported and set them up in the 2 centers. Soon the new 2 computerized centers will be launched.</p>

              <h2>Background and Planning Section</h2>
              <p>Our team visited Neduvasal village a month before implementation in order to understand the situation better and discuss the requirements of the school. We made discussions with the Headmaster, the Medical Officer of the region, and the community members (students and parents) to understand the nuances.<br>
              —————————————————</p>
              <p><strong><em>ABOUT THE VILLAGE</em></strong></p>
              <p>The village consists of two hamlets and has a total population of around 1200. There are 3 main categories of people (based on their occupation). These are:<br>
              1. Agricultural laborers (the farm owners typically do not stay in the village)<br>
              2. Artisans who make mud pots<br>
              3. Non farm laborers (this section of people generally go for hunting rabbits and bats in the night time for consumption. Bat-hunting has been stopped recently through the efforts of the HM and the police)</p>
              <p>Till recently, there were no bus facilities that reached the village. Most of the adult residents are illiterate. All the residences that we could observe were straw and mud huts. Also, nearly all the smaller children (less than around 6 years) were walking near their homes or on the street naked. It should definitely be among the least developed regions in the state.</p>
              <p><strong><em>ABOUT THE SCHOOL</em></strong></p>
              <p>The Neduvasal primary school (classes till standard 5) was the worst performing in the district till a few years back. In 2004, the current HM specifically asked to be posted here. Through community involvement, he has been able to bring about a better discipline in terms of school attendance and enrolment, get parents to contribute their efforts in maintaining the infrastructure, and impart learning to their children. Currently, in terms of the metrics, the school is supposedly among the best performing (academically) in the district.</p>
              <p>After completing standard 5 here, the students continue their studies at the Higher Secondary School which is a few kilometres away. The dropout rate after standard 5 was as high as 64% earlier and has now reduced to less than 5%.</p>
              <p>Through our discussions &nbsp;we came to know that HM is not only playing the role of a teacher/principal but also a facilitator to villagers in getting them closer to their rights and services provided by the Govt &nbsp; . He has been very well able to leverage his understanding and “know how” of the govt &nbsp;policies. Those like Jayalalitha’s cleanest village reward scheme(achieving the B-Grade award- 1.5 Lakhs), Namakku Naamey (NMN) RTI,Sarva Siksha abhayan, getting NREGA reach the needy, getting the road constructed through petitions,abolition of hunting bats by punishing a couple of people who violated,writing up to the bank officials to get their old PCs &nbsp;etc &nbsp;and finally by making that known to all, he has earned the respect of the public and their support. Which inturn will make the people confident that their children are in the safe and secure Hands of the HM.</p>
              <p><strong><em>MAIN PROBLEMS FACED CURRENTLY AND PROPOSED SOLUTION</em></strong></p>
              <p>There are two main problems that the villagers currently face in relation to schooling.</p>
              <p><strong><em>1. Undernourishment</em></strong></p>
              <p>A recent health check-up of the schoolchildren reveals that 97% of them are underweight (the rest 3% are the HM’s own children). Fainting and vomiting (due to intake of food which might be 2 or 3 days old) are common occurences. Some children do not even have any breakfast when they arrive to the school. Others arrive late (around 11 AM) because of delays in cooking at home (the mother might have work at other homes early in the morning, might leave the kid under the care of the neighbor, etc.). Atypical to the age, most kids are not even observed playing / fighting during the breaks.</p>
              <p>In order to address undernourishment and thereby the resulting problems, the Medical Officer of the region (a 2005 batch MBBS from Madras Medical College whom we met with) and his Professor have come up with a comprehensive diet (Navadanya) which is to be given as breakfast every day. We were &nbsp;shown the documents which detailed the proposal and the ingredients of the food.Some of the ingredients are planned to be obtained from the village community while the rest needs to be purchased. Considering this, the per child per breakfast cost comes to Rupees 3.5 Rs/day.For 70 children (the school strength ) across 210 days per year, the total amount required would be Rupees 51,450. The school requests us to fund this amount in a quarterly fashion (around Rupees 12,000 every 3 months).</p>
              <p><strong><em>2. Affordability</em></strong></p>
              <p>As a government school, there isn’t any significant fees the students need to pay and the books are provided free of cost. However, some of the families find it difficult to afford uniforms, notebooks, transport to the school (either this school or the higher secondary). These include: (1) single parent families (2) two parent families with a drunkard and economically useless husband (3) families with disabled parents (4) socially outcast single mother families (unmarried mother) (5) orphans.</p>
              <p>Around 25 children in the village require some kind of scholarship so that they can continue their schooling without making it too difficult for their families. The scholarship would be in the form of buying them uniforms, notebooks, and cycles, wethought. We had later &nbsp;asked the HM to furnish details of each of these students, their family situation, and their requirement. &nbsp;Below is the link for the details that we obtained a few weeks later.</p>
              <p><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Arj48_cWPa9SdHBHd1d0SFByMkpxVGVvamgxODU5dnc&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CKGL9NUL">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Arj48_cWPa9SdHBHd1d0SFByMkpxVGVvamgxODU5dnc&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CKGL9NUL</a></p>
              <p><strong><em>ISSUES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRUST</em></strong></p>
              <p>We would not be giving any money directly to the school / HM. It would instead be routed through the district administration (the Collector and the District Education and other departments) who would purchase and provide the required physical item to the students / school. This is how money to the school (used for purchasing white boards, teaching material, etc.) has been donated earlier.<br>

              <h2>Implementation and Execution Section</h2>
              <p><strong><em>Scholarships and Inspiring destitute parent</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">The &nbsp;scholarships (were disbursed to students &nbsp;not just from Neduvasal but from other Higher Sec schools of &nbsp;villages covering a radius of 15-20 Km.Incidentally Scholarship was given mostly to students of 7th, 8th,9th and above and even a polytechnic student (2nd yr after completing 12th) with just 5 of them from below 5th grade.</span><em> <strong> </strong></em></strong>Mr.Karuppaiyan briefed about the family background and lifestyle of all the children who were gathered for the scholarships. Most of them had single parent, some were partially blind and one child was badly ravaged by fire, while studying with a kerosene lamp when heavy wind blew the lamp in the process catching fire on him. We literally broke down to tears hearing their stories and&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">realized how gifted we are in life. &nbsp;<span style="font-style: normal;">HM</span>,&nbsp;<span style="font-style: normal;">Karuppian hand picked the students&nbsp;based on their needs and background.</span></span></em></strong></p>
              <p>During the event we inspired ( in our best way possible) &nbsp;the parents&nbsp;to continue the travails they have been taking in educating their children. We took this occasion in explaining them the support they could get from Government ( like loans based only on marks, &nbsp;no need of any collateral what so ever) &nbsp;and institutions and support groups like us.</p>
              <p><em><strong>NAVADHANYA &nbsp;SCHEME</strong></em></p>
              <p>Initiated, as planned, the Navadhanya scheme – A sort of energy drink (khoolu ) consisting of all(9) essential nutrients which currently could be the most important value add to the students,( with all children, looking at their under-weights,&nbsp;heights, and &nbsp;anemic&nbsp;stature ) and &nbsp;this could herald for Govt or Collector taking up &nbsp;such an initiative in other schools in the long run<strong>. </strong>And handed over the cheque of Rs 20,000 &nbsp;for the first quarter commitment for the daily Navadhanya scheme and the need based scholarships.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Sharing Best Practices Of &nbsp;City schools and Corporate trainings</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong> </strong>We also had a discussion on the best practices and improvements with teachers ( Malathi &nbsp;Usha &nbsp;&amp; HM ). We gave some good examples on how to implement this and it was worth the “45 min”.Instead of just creating language labs and science labs we opined them to make such infrastructure of much more use through,question session,”completing the&nbsp;English&nbsp;short story” session, listening classes, cartoon shows in english, best doubt of the week ( why fan rotates anticlockwise, why black board is black etc ). We also promised to share the practically feasible methods implemented in other countries like US.</p>

              <li>The objective behind Navadhanya is improving the health of the students . And for this a base health report on/before the start of Navadhanya( planned this week ) and a monthly health check up to track the progress have been committed.</li>
              <li>Navadhanya scheme is also supposed to bring down the absentees and provide incentive for children to come to school on time @ 9.00. This will be tracked on a daily basis through registering their&nbsp;attendance and the time&nbsp;of their arrival. And the same will be reported on fortnightly basis to us.</li>
              <li>The scanned copy of the student and&nbsp;their parent details receiving&nbsp;scholarships and their contacts will be shared to us shortly to have a p ersonal interaction with these students on a periodic basis to to inspire and motivate them.</li>
              <li>The soft copy of the activities and achievements (maintained by him as album ) will be shared shortly.</li>
